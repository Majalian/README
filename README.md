Born as a native Arabic speaker and born again as a native English speaker!
I have been working as an Arabic/English translator for quite some time now.

I have plenty of experience doing translations in either direction and can take on any job you might have! trust me I can :)

Also, I have a quick turnaround as I have a lot of available time to do your job in a correct and professional manner since I try to earn the title of "BEST ARABIC TRANSLATOR IN JORDAN"!

My services include:
- All sorts of translations (general/business/medical/technical/legal etc.) from my languages (Arabic and English)
- Proofreading, Editing & Language Analysis in Arabic and English language (Spelling, Grammar, Style, Sentiment, Usage, Meaning, etc.)
- Basic digital services like data processing, text processing or web research.

Why clients hire me:

- I work quickly and accurately and give them the attention they deserve!
- Punctual delivery is guaranteed.
- I am interested in specifics and I ask the right questions
- I communicate task-related issues clearly and effectively before, during and after
the job
- I am highly reliable and constantly available, with a response time of maximum 12,
but mostly less than 3 hours (no matter which time zone)
- I am flexible and adaptive to the needs of the client and the particular
requirements of the job
